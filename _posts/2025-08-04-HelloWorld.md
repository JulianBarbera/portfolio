> In the midway of this our mortal life, I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
> Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell It were no easy task, how

> remember only, my<br> dismay Renews, in bitterness not far from death. Yet to
> discourse of what<br> there good befell, All else will I relate discover’d
> there.<br>

_- Dante Alighieri, Inferno, 1321_
